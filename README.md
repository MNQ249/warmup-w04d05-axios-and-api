# API & AXIOS
We're gonna practice more of accessing API's with Axios, using our own class website!

### Display All SEI students

- Use this link to access all the students in our website

```js 
const baseUrl = `https://sei-relativity-ruh.herokuapp.com/developers`
```

- display each name as a list item within the #main div.

`<li></li>`

### Add your name to the list

>Our database accepts `name` as a param

- link the form so that it will take the value of whatever is written in the input field and adds it using Axios to our website's database as a new student
